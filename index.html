                <p class="lead">3D printing and website design</p>
        <p>Project 1 involved 3D printing a name tag, an object of our choosing that had a slight overhang, and creating a website (you're looking at the 3rd one right now). I will admit that this project is not very hard for me until I started creating a website. Since I have 0 experience with this, I've had to dedicate extra time in my life (and pull 1 all nighter) to complete this project to not sacrifice the quality of work in exchange for completion.</p>

        <p>Overall, the prints were successful. The name tag print worked well, with slight error to word placement due to how the name was so short I had to convert 2 lines into 1 line for my name in order for the print to come out aesthetically pleasing without wasted space. As for the overhang print, with and without support they came out more or less the same, but the print with no support was far more smoother than the print with support. However, the print with support didn't have any printing problems for the error, but the print without support has a piece of plastic sticking out of the top facing downwards. Minor issues, but I think I could have experimented with a more extreme overhang to find a more interesting result. I learned that STLs are (in general) simpler meshes to print out, while 3mf files are more detailed and thus are larger and would also store the settings needed for 3d printers.</p>
        <p>While designing this website, I tried to implement an internal-hyperlink system where you can click on the name of the project (e.g click on project 1 on the first page) and then jump to the part on this page about project 1. However, both due to my inexperience and time constraints for this project, this was not implemented at the deadline of Project 1. I will, however, still be trying to implement it. Despite this, though, I was able to get the boxes and background working properly, as well as having experimented with the links at the top of the page (do not click on rickroll link if you are wearing headphones). I also realized after the project was graded that there's a certain screen size that completly messes up the layout website when viewed. I didn't notice until it was pointed out since I usually check the website's functionality on a normal fully-sized widow and will be working on fixing this error.</p>

        <p>Project 2 involved using CAD apps like TinkerCAD and Autodesk to generate 3D printing designs. This also doubles as a project that allows one to familiarize themselves with the CAD apps and see for themselves how simpler CAD apps like TinkerCAD generally generate 3D prints that are larger and more coarse, while the more complicated apps like Autodesk generate smaller and more precise designs.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;">REFLECTION</h3>
        <p>The beginning of the project, choosing an existing design available online and remixing it, was hard not because of the remixing, but because I genuinely could not settle on what to pick. As a result, I racked my brains together going over what I like and, after realizing my insane obsession with tanks, decided I may as well print out something similar to a US tank star decal from the world war 2 era. Suprisingly, tinkercad was actually the harder to use CAD design application for me since it had very limited mobility options, and the spaces were often too big that it snaps onto a wrong spot and in the 3d print of the design one of the 5 holes I added as an aesthetic didn't even show up. Additionally, the print made from tinkercad (right image) was larger and more coarse in its finer details.</p>
        <p>In contrast, I found that Autodesk is both (somehow) easier and more accurate when it comes to designing. Sure I had to make the entire thing again, but after fiddling around to see how I can effectively make a star there really wasn't a lot of problems for me since I managed to learn how to use the add polygon feature to essentially make a star from scratch. I also admittedly had a bit of fun deciding whether I wanted a cylynder to form the holes or if I wanted a sphere (I ended up making it a sphere hole, I felt it looked better as a gradual sphere rather than a solid straight hole)</p>
        <p>Over all, the project was a success since my goal of an aesthetically pleasing and improved design was achieved, and due to the simplicity of the design I don't think I would change anything regarding the design elements.</p>

                <p class="lead">Desigining 3D prints using CAD for an object</p>
        <p>Project 3 involved using Autodesk to generate 3D printing designs, which we did by taking specific measurements for a circuit board and designed a casemate for the circuit board. Individual components (e.g the analog timer, the buttons) had to also be exposed and usable, and therefore the difficult of the project was significant</p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;">REFLECTION</h3>
        <p>Project 3 was a project that took us way longer than expected to finish. We started with soldering the circuit board, which was the easy and fast part once we figured out which direction all the components were supposed to be facing. Afterwards, we began the design process for a chassis for the alarm clock system. My partner and I decided on a simple box, which then became more complicated as we created accomidations for the buttons and the analog clock timer. The process was rather simple, though. We had to createa a box then hollow it out and make a cover for the back of the box. Afterwards, we measured out specific lengths and adjusted the box, before we cut out holes on Autodesk into the box for the buttons and the clock timer. However, laser cutting involved creating each individual face with connecting points, so we spent about 2 hours redesigning the whole box surface by surface with interlocking nubs that would allow the surfaces to connect without excess use of glue or other adhesive materials</p>
        <p>The most time consuming process was designing the hinges that will latch onto each other in the laser cut. We had a very easy time designing the 3D print box, but for the laser cut we had to account for a lot more things, and we also had to redo some surfaces after realizing that we did something to the original file that made it impossible to measure the surfaces properly, and the fact that we had to account for the 3rd dimension meant that we actually had to go back a few times to readadjust the holes we made for the hinges because we realized that there would be no way to fit them properly when it came to the corners as one side always had a bit more space than needed. Therefore, during our second laser cutting session, we increased the size of the top and lower plate so that the finger hinges can fit better onto each other. It still wasn't perfect, but it was satisfactory and produced a decent-looking end product </p>
